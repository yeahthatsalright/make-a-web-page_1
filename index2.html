			<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
				<p>HTML stands for <em>hypertext markup language</em> and is styled by the CSS or <em>cascading style sheet</em>. The HTML controls what specific structure the web page will have while the CSS will control how the objects and text will look inside the structure</p>
			<h3>Document Object Model</h3>
				<p>The <em>document object model</em> or DOM refers to the tree like structure that a page is given through commands with the CSS styling.

			<h3>Boxifying</h3>
				<p>This term refers to the box like nature of HTML structure. Boxes can be repositioned within the structure by finding its corresponding "div" and applying a “display: flex” within the CSS document to override the linear design that it accustomed to. Boxes can be controlled through the CSS by changing the margining or how the border will interact with the text.
				</p>
			<h3>Verifying Code</h3>
				<p>Several free online code verification services are available to those that need it. Since programmers are likely to make simple mistakes or repeat unnecessary value, it is always handy to have an online resource the can debug and tell you where you might have made errors.
				</p>
			<h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
				<p>When writing code, it is always a great idea to avoid repetition when writing your code. This basically means using various class structure and command runs to simplfy your code. In javascript this is done with setting up things like data arrays.
